# MyStyle - Personalized Clothing Platform MVP

**Welcome to MyStyle!** ðŸ‘•âœ¨  
MyStyle is a student project developed as part of the Digital Marketing & E-commerce module at EHEI Oujda, Morocco. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows users to customize clothing items like t-shirts, sweats, caps, and tote bags by selecting models, colors, adding text or motifs, and previewing designs in real-time. Inspired by Lean Startup principles, it's designed for quick testing and market validation through a simple, interactive web prototype.

## Project Overview
MyStyle aims to solve the challenge of accessing unique, personalized clothing in Morocco, especially in Oujda. Users can express their personality by creating custom designs, which are then printed on-demand via local partnerships (e.g., printers in Oujda). This project focuses on e-commerce basics, making it easy to test ideas before scaling to a full platform.

- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive editor: Choose from models (t-shirt, sweat, etc.), select colors, add custom text, and upload motifs.
  - Real-time preview: See your design update instantly without reloading the page.
  - Pre-order form: Simulate orders and collect user feedback.
  - Integration with feedback tools: Links to a Google Forms questionnaire for market validation.
  
- **Why this project?**  
  This MVP was built to apply Lean Startup methodology â€“ build, measure, learn. We're validating user interest in personalized fashion through simple tools, with plans to expand to full e-commerce features like payments and shipping.
